                        <p>HI! I'm Nerry. I am a part-time babysitter. I am currently enrolled in the University of Cebu. Taking up the degree in Bachelor of Science in Education. I am looking forward to look after a child and earn money through it. I hope youâ€™ll considered me in taking care of your child. I am doing this because I love playing with kids and also for extra allowance for my school.</p>
